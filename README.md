# Power Volley Pong

_A multi-player racquet sport that is a mix between Volley Ball and Table Tennis (sort of...)._

Daniel's adaptataion of the standard rule set originating in 2010. This rule set leans more towards volleyball played on a ping pong table.

## Description

A designated player from the serving team will commence in _service_. The player serves the ball to the opposing side in the same way that a "Doubles Table Tennis" match would be served. 

The opposing side must hit the ball, alternating between players until the ball is sent over the net.

The returning team either commits an error and yields the point to the opposition; or, an offensive attempt is made by returning the ball to the original side of the table for the other team to handle. The process continues until one of the teams score.

## Starting the game

A random player sets the ball up for the next player to their left; moving in a clockwise direction. Each succeeding player will also set the ball up. The first player to make an error yields the first _service_ to the opposing team.


## Number of players

* This game will always be played with two (2) players on each side.


## Positions

Players are organized with one player on the right, and one player on the left.

The player who serves the ball will always be the right side player, though they can stand anywhere behind the table.

When a point is made so that your team begins serving (ending the other team's serve), the players will rotate (switch left and right), and the new right side player will begin serving.

## Service

The team who wins the previous point will initiate play with a serve.

If the opposition initiates play with a serve and a point is scored (known as a "sideout" point), your team rotates and will serve.

The service is similar to a serve in "Doubles Table Tennis," where the following criteria are met:

1. The ball is tossed straight up by the server at least 6 inches.
2. It is struck, and bounces on the server's side of the table first, over the net, the bounces on the opposing team's side of the table.

_The side of which the serve hits on the table is not relevant._

## Scoring

In order to win the match, a team must:
* Be the first to reach 21 points.
* Have a 2 point lead.

If 21 is reached but there is not a lead of 2 points, then the game continues until the 2 point lead is reached.

## Rallies
A _Rally_ is continuous play initiated by a serve and ends when a point is awarded. 

A Rally ends in the following conditions:
* An illegal play/contact is made.
* The ball touches the ground.
* The ball bounces on the table twice in a row (excluding serves)
* The ball stops moving (ex: ball comes to a rest on a couch)

## Defense

A round of defence starts when either the ball is served into play, or the opposing team makes an offensive strike.

On service, an offensive strike can only be made on the third contact. On successive rallies, an offensive strike can be made either on the second or third contact if an offenseive strike is permitted. 

If the ball is hit more than 3 times, or if the ball bounces on the table after the initial bounce, an offensive strike cannot be made, and a "freeball" must be sent over. (see _freeball_ secton.)

NOTE: No player shall hit the ball two times in a row. Ever!

## Offensive Strike

An offensive strike is permitted, but not required, on a team's second or third contact, however an offensive strike cannot be made on the second contact directly after a serve.

An offensive strike cannot be made if any of the following conditions are met:
* The ball touches the same side of the table after player contact (note this does not end the rally)
* The third contact has already been made. (An offenseive strike cannot be made on the fourth or higher contact)

An offensive strike must either bounce on the opposing team's side of the table one time or make contact with a blocking player. If the ball does not bounce on the opponent's side of the table or is not touched by a blocking player, then a point is awarded to the opposition.

An offensive strike must cross over the net, but may not pass on the outside of the poles that hold the net taut.  

**NOTE: Returning the ball to the opposing side IS NOT PERMITTED if the offensive player's bat goes passed the physical or logical line dividing the table (ie. the net).**


## Freeballs

A freeball must be sent over the net when an offensive strike cannot be made by the team currently playing the ball.

A freeball must meet the following conditions:
* Be made with an underhand contact.
* Maximum height of the ball tragectory reaches at least player's chest height.
* Be travelling upwards at the point it crosses over the opponent's side of the table.
* Bounce on the opponents side.

## Blocking

The purpose of blocking is to get in the way of an opponent's offensive strike to slow the ball down or deny the opponent's attempt at sending the ball to your side.

Blocking is most effective by standing close to the net, leaning over the table with your body and oustretching your arms and paddle.

You cannot reach over to the opponent's side of the net when blocking. 

If you make contact with the ball and it sends the ball back to the opponent, the opponent can play the ball as if it were sent over normally (ie, the opposition has another three touches to make an offensive strike)

If you make contact with the ball and it continues to your side of the net, resume play normally as if no player has yet made contact with the ball. The ball may bounce on the table, or a player can make contact directly with their paddle.

If you make contact with the ball and it sends the ball out of bounds and ends the rally, a point is awarded to the attacking team.

## Equipment
 
The game is typically played with table tennis racquets and a table tennis ball.  Although there _could_ be alternatives, each player should use the same type of racquet.

## Surroundings

Any and all surrounding surfaces are "fair game" and you may continue play.


### Author's Note:
This is the version of volley pong I used to play in high school and college. I and the people I played with were all high level volleyball players, so the games had a lot of power behind them.
